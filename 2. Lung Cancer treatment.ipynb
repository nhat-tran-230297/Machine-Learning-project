       "   'standard treatment options for stages ia and ib nsclcstandard treatment  options for stages ia non-small cell lung cancer (nsclc) and ib nsclc include the following:surgery.radiation therapy (for patients who cannot have surgery or choose not to have surgery).chemotherapy and radiation therapy have not been shown to improve outcomes in stage i nsclc that has been completely resected.surgerysurgery is the treatment of choice for patients with stage i  nsclc. a lobectomy or segmental, wedge, or sleeve resection may be performed as appropriate. patients\\nwith impaired pulmonary function are candidates for segmental or wedge\\nresection of the primary tumor. careful preoperative assessment of the patientâ€™s overall\\nmedical condition, especially the patientâ€™s pulmonary reserve, is critical in\\nconsidering the benefits of surgery. the immediate postoperative mortality\\nrate is age related, but a 3% to 5%  mortality rate  with lobectomy can be expected.[1]evidence (surgery):the lung cancer study group conducted a\\nrandomized study (lcsg-821)  that compared lobectomy with limited resection for\\npatients with stage i lung cancer. results of the study showed the following:[2]a\\nreduction in local recurrence for patients treated with lobectomy compared with\\nthose treated with limited excision.no significant difference in overall\\nsurvival (os).similar results have been reported from a nonrandomized\\ncomparison of anatomic segmentectomy and lobectomy.[3]a survival advantage\\nwas noted with lobectomy for patients with tumors larger  than 3 cm \\nbut not for those with tumors smaller than 3 cm.the rate of\\nlocoregional recurrence was significantly less after lobectomy, regardless of\\nprimary tumor size.a study of stage i patients showed the following:[4]those treated with wedge or segmental resections had a local recurrence rate of 50% (i.e., 31 recurrences out of 62 patients) despite having undergone complete resections.[4]the cochrane collaboration reviewed 11 randomized trials with a total of 1,910 patients who underwent surgical interventions for early-stage (iâ€“iiia) lung cancer.[5] a pooled analysis of three trials reported the following:four-year survival was superior in patients with resectable stage i,  ii, or iiia nsclc who underwent resection and complete ipsilateral mediastinal lymph node dissection (cmlnd), compared with those who underwent resection and lymph node sampling; the hazard ratio (hr) was estimated to be 0.78 (95% confidence interval [ci], 0.65â€“0.93, p =  .005).[5][level of evidence: 1iia]there was a significant reduction in any cancer recurrence (local or distant) in the cmlnd group (relative risk [rr], 0.79; 95% ci, 0.66â€“0.95; p = .01) that appeared mainly because of  a reduction in the number of distant recurrences (rr,  0.78; 95% ci,  0.61â€“1.00; p = .05).there was no difference in operative mortality.air leak lasting more than 5 days was significantly more common in patients assigned to cmlnd (rr,  2.94; 95% ci,  1.01â€“8.54; p = .05). cmlnd versus lymph node   sampling  was evaluated in a large randomized phase iii trial (acosog-z0030 [nct00003831]).[6,7]preliminary analyses of operative morbidity and mortality showed comparable rates from the procedures.[6,7]there was no difference in os, disease-free survival, local recurrence, and regional recurrence.[7][level of evidence: 1iia]current evidence suggests that lung cancer resection combined with cmlnd is not associated with improvement in survival compared with lung cancer resection combined with systematic sampling of mediastinal lymph nodes in patients with stage i, ii, or iiia nsclc.[7][level of evidence: 1iia]limitations of evidence (surgery):conclusions about the efficacy of surgery for patients with local and locoregional nsclc are limited by the small number of participants studied to date and the potential methodological weaknesses of the trials.adjuvant therapymany patients treated surgically subsequently develop regional or distant\\nmetastases.[8] such patients are candidates for entry into clinical trials evaluating    postoperative treatment with chemotherapy or radiation\\ntherapy following surgery.  at present, neither chemotherapy nor radiation therapy has been found to improve the outcome of patients with stage i nsclc that has been completely resected. adjuvant radiation therapy the value of postoperative (adjuvant) radiation therapy (port) has been evaluated and has not been found to improve the outcome of patients with completely resected stage i nsclc.[9]evidence (adjuvant radiation therapy):a meta-analysis, based on the results of ten randomized controlled trials and 2,232 individuals, reported the following:[9]an 18% relative increase in the risk of death for patients who received port compared with surgery alone (hr,  1.18; p = .002). this is equivalent to an absolute detriment of 6% at 2 years (95% ci, 2â€“9), reducing os from 58% to 52%. exploratory subgroup analyses suggested that this detrimental effect was most pronounced for patients with stage i/ii, n0-n1 disease, whereas for patients with stage iii, n2 disease, there was no clear evidence of an adverse effect.results for local (hr, 1.13; p = .02), distant (hr, 1.14; p = .02), and overall (hr, 1.10; p = .06) recurrence-free survival similarly showed a detriment of port.[9][level of evidence: 1iia]further analysis is needed to determine whether these outcomes can potentially be modified with technical improvements,\\nbetter definitions of target volumes, and limitation of cardiac volume in the\\nradiation portals.    \\nadjuvant brachytherapy the value of intraoperative (adjuvant) brachytherapy applied to the suture line has been evaluated in patients undergoing sublobar resections for stage i nsclc to improve local control; it has not been found to improve outcomes. evidence (adjuvant brachytherapy):\\ta phase iii trial that randomly assigned 222 patients to undergo sublobar resection with or without suture line brachytherapy reported the following:[10]\\tno difference in the primary endpoint of local recurrence (5-year estimate, 14.0% vs. 16.7%; p = .59). \\tno difference in os (5-year estimate, 61.4% vs. 55.6%; p = .38).[10][level of evidence: 1iidiii] vs [level of evidence: 1iia]adjuvant chemotherapybased on a meta-analysis, postoperative chemotherapy is not recommended outside of a clinical trial for patients with completely resected stage i nsclc.[11,12][level of evidence: 1iia]evidence (adjuvant chemotherapy for stage i  nsclc):data on individual patient outcomes from the five largest trials (4,584 patients) that were conducted after 1995 of cisplatin-based chemotherapy in patients with completely resected nsclc were collected and pooled into a meta-analysis.[13]with a median follow-up of 5.2 years, the overall hrdeath was 0.89 (95% ci, 0.82â€“0.96; p = .005), corresponding to a 5-year absolute benefit of 5.4% from chemotherapy. the benefit \\nvaried with stage (test for trend, p = .04; hr for stage ia, 1.40; 95% ci, 0.95â€“2.06; hr for stage ib, 0.93; 95% ci, 0.78â€“1.10; hr for stage ii, 0.83; 95% ci, 0.73â€“0.95; and hr for stage iii, 0.83; 95% ci, 0.72â€“0.94).the effect of chemotherapy did not vary significantly (test for interaction, p = .11) with the associated drugs, including vinorelbine (hr, 0.80; 95% ci, 0.70â€“0.91), etoposide or vinca alkaloid (hr, 0.92; 95% ci, 0.80â€“1.07), or other drugs (hr, 0.97; 95% ci, 0.84â€“1.13).the apparent greater benefit seen with vinorelbine should be interpreted cautiously as vinorelbine and cisplatin combinations generally required that a higher dose of cisplatin be given. chemotherapy effect was higher in patients with a better performance status. there was no interaction between chemotherapy effect and any of the following:sex.age.histology.type of surgery.planned radiation therapy.planned total dose of cisplatin.several other randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses have evaluated the use of  postoperative chemotherapy in patients with stages i, ii, and iiia nsclc.[13-19]although there is sufficient evidence that postoperative chemotherapy is effective in patients with stage ii or stage iiia nsclc, its usefulness  in patients with stage ib nsclc is less clear.evidence (adjuvant chemotherapy for stage ib nsclc):the cancer and leukemia group b study (calgb-9633 [nct00002852]) addressed the results of adjuvant carboplatin and paclitaxel versus observation for  os in 344 patients with resected stage ib (i.e., pathological t2, n0) nsclc. within 4 to 8 weeks of resection, patients were randomly assigned to postoperative chemotherapy or observation.[20]survival was not significantly different (hr,  0.83; ci, 0.64â€“1.08; p = .12) at a median follow-up of 74 months.grades 3 to 4 neutropenia were the predominant toxicity; there were no treatment-related deaths.a post-hoc exploratory analysis demonstrated a significant survival difference in favor of postoperative chemotherapy for patients who had tumors 4 cm or larger in diameter (hr, 0.69; ci, 0.48â€“0.99; p = .043).  given the magnitude of observed survival differences, calgb-9633 may have been underpowered to detect small but clinically meaningful improvements in survival. in addition, the use of a carboplatin versus a cisplatin combination might have affected the results.   at present, there is no reliable evidence that postoperative chemotherapy improves survival of patients with stage ib nsclc.[20][level of evidence: 1iia]radiation therapypatients with potentially resectable tumors with medical contraindications to surgery or those with inoperable stage i disease and with sufficient pulmonary reserve\\nmay be candidates for radiation therapy with curative intent. conventional radiation therapyhistorically, conventional primary radiation therapy  consisted of approximately 60  gy to 70 gy delivered\\nwith megavoltage equipment to the midplane of the known tumor volume using\\nconventional fractionation (1.8â€“2.0 gy per day).  prognosis:in the largest retrospective conventional radiation\\ntherapy series, patients with inoperable disease treated with definitive\\nradiation therapy achieved 5-year survival rates of 10% to 30%.[21-23] several \\nseries demonstrated that patients with t1, n0 tumors had better outcomes,  and 5-year survival rates of 30% to 60% were found in this subgroup.[21,22,24] however, local-only failure occurs in as many as 50% of patients treated with conventional radiation therapy to doses in the range of 60 gy to 65 gy.[25,26] evidence (conventional radiation therapy):a single\\nreport of patients older than 70 years who had resectable lesions\\n smaller  than 4 cm but who had medically inoperable disease or who\\nrefused surgery reported the following:[24]survival at 5 years after radiation therapy with curative\\nintent was comparable with a  historical control group of patients of similar age\\nwho were resected with curative intent.a small case series using matched controls reported the following:[4]the addition of endobronchial brachytherapy improved local disease control compared with external-beam radiation therapy (ebrt).[4][level of evidence: 3iiidiii]a substantial number of patients are ineligible for standard surgical resection because of comorbid conditions that are associated with unacceptably high perioperative risk. observation and radiation therapy may be considered for these patients.[27-29] nonrandomized observational studies comparing treatment outcomes associated with resection, radiation therapy, and observation have demonstrated shorter survival times and higher mortality for patients treated with observation only.[27,30] improvements in radiation techniques include planning techniques to account for tumor motion, more conformal planning techniques (e.g., 3-d conformal radiation therapy and intensity-modulated radiation therapy), and image guidance during treatment. modern approaches to delivery of ebrt include hypofractionated radiation therapy and stereotactic body radiation therapy (sbrt).however, there are limited reliable data from comparative trials to determine which approaches yield superior outcomes.[28,29]hypofractionated radiation therapyhypofractionated radiation therapy involves the delivery of a slightly higher dose of radiation therapy per day (e.g., 2.4â€“4.0 gy) over a shorter period of time compared with conventionally fractionated radiation therapy.  multiple prospective phase i/ii trials have demonstrated that hypofractionated radiation therapy to a dose of 60 gy to 70 gy delivered over 3 to 4 weeks with 2.4 gy to 4.0 gy per day resulted in a low incidence of moderate to severe toxicity, 2-year os of 50% to 60%, and 2-year tumor local control of 80% to 90%.[31-33][level of evidence: 3iiia]stereotactic body radiation therapy (sbrt)sbrt involves the delivery of highly conformal, high-dose radiation therapy over an extremely hypofractionated course (e.g., one to five treatments) delivered over 1 to 2 weeks.  commonly used regimens include 18 gy Ã— 3, 12 gy to 12.5 gy Ã— 4, and 10 gy to 12 gy Ã— 5, and deliver a substantially higher biologically effective dose compared with historic conventional radiation therapy regimens.  multiple prospective phase i/ii trials and institutional series have demonstrated that sbrt results in a low incidence of pulmonary toxicity (<10% risk of symptomatic radiation pneumonitis), 2-year os of 50% to 60%, and 2-year tumor control of 90% to 95%.[34-40][level of evidence: 3iiia]evidence (sbrt):early phase i/ii trials from indiana university identified the maximum tolerated dose of three-fraction sbrt at 18 gy Ã— 3 for t1 tumors, and this regimen resulted in 2-year os of 55% and 2-year local tumor control of 95%.an unacceptably high incidence (8.6%) of grade 5 toxicity was observed in patients with central tumors (defined as within 2 cm of the tracheobronchial tree from the trachea to the level of the lobar bronchi).[35]a subsequent multicenter trial (rtog-0236 [nct00087438]) studied the 18 gy Ã— 3 regimen in 55 patients with peripheral t1 to t2 tumors only and demonstrated 3-year os of 56% and 3-year primary tumor control of 98%.the incidence of moderate to severe toxicity was low, with grade 3 toxicity in 24% of patients, grade 4 toxicity in 4% of patients, and no grade 5 toxicity, with a 4% incidence of grade 3 radiation pneumonitis.[39]in the largest reported series from vu university medical center amsterdam, 676 patients with t1 to t2 tumors were treated with three-, five-, and eight-fraction sbrt using a risk-adapted approach (a tailored fractionation regimen based on tumor proximity to critical organs).with a median follow-up of 32.9 months, the median os was 40.7 months, and 2-year local tumor control was 95%.[40]\\twhile central location is a contraindication to three-fraction sbrt based on data from the indiana phase ii study, a subsequent systematic review of published reports of 315 patients with 563 central tumors demonstrated a much lower incidence of severe toxicity, including a 1% to 5% risk of grade 5 events with more protracted sbrt regimens (e.g., four to ten fractions).[41]  a multicenter phase i/ii trial (rtog-0813 [nct00750269]) is ongoing to identify the maximum tolerated dose for a five-fraction sbrt regimen for central tumors. randomized trials of conventional radiation therapy versus sbrt (nct01014130), and hypofractionated radiation therapy versus sbrt (lustre [nct01968941]) are ongoing to determine the optimal radiation therapy regimen, but stereotactic body radiation therapy has been widely adopted for patients with medically inoperable stage i nsclc.treatment options under clinical evaluationtreatment options under clinical evaluation include the following:clinical trials of  postoperative chemoprevention (as evidenced in the eastern  cooperative oncology group (ecog) (ecog-5597 [nct00008385] trial, for example).endobronchial therapies, including photodynamic therapy, for highly selected patients with t1, n0, m0 tumors.current clinical trialsuse our advanced

       "   'radiation therapypatients with potentially resectable tumors with medical contraindications to surgery or those with inoperable stage i disease and with sufficient pulmonary reserve\\nmay be candidates for radiation therapy with curative intent. conventional radiation therapyhistorically, conventional primary radiation therapy  consisted of approximately 60  gy to 70 gy delivered\\nwith megavoltage equipment to the midplane of the known tumor volume using\\nconventional fractionation (1.8â€“2.0 gy per day).  prognosis:in the largest retrospective conventional radiation\\ntherapy series, patients with inoperable disease treated with definitive\\nradiation therapy achieved 5-year survival rates of 10% to 30%.[21-23] several \\nseries demonstrated that patients with t1, n0 tumors had better outcomes,  and 5-year survival rates of 30% to 60% were found in this subgroup.[21,22,24] however, local-only failure occurs in as many as 50% of patients treated with conventional radiation therapy to doses in the range of 60 gy to 65 gy.[25,26] evidence (conventional radiation therapy):a single\\nreport of patients older than 70 years who had resectable lesions\\n smaller  than 4 cm but who had medically inoperable disease or who\\nrefused surgery reported the following:[24]survival at 5 years after radiation therapy with curative\\nintent was comparable with a  historical control group of patients of similar age\\nwho were resected with curative intent.a small case series using matched controls reported the following:[4]the addition of endobronchial brachytherapy improved local disease control compared with external-beam radiation therapy (ebrt).[4][level of evidence: 3iiidiii]a substantial number of patients are ineligible for standard surgical resection because of comorbid conditions that are associated with unacceptably high perioperative risk. observation and radiation therapy may be considered for these patients.[27-29] nonrandomized observational studies comparing treatment outcomes associated with resection, radiation therapy, and observation have demonstrated shorter survival times and higher mortality for patients treated with observation only.[27,30] improvements in radiation techniques include planning techniques to account for tumor motion, more conformal planning techniques (e.g., 3-d conformal radiation therapy and intensity-modulated radiation therapy), and image guidance during treatment. modern approaches to delivery of ebrt include hypofractionated radiation therapy and stereotactic body radiation therapy (sbrt).however, there are limited reliable data from comparative trials to determine which approaches yield superior outcomes.[28,29]hypofractionated radiation therapyhypofractionated radiation therapy involves the delivery of a slightly higher dose of radiation therapy per day (e.g., 2.4â€“4.0 gy) over a shorter period of time compared with conventionally fractionated radiation therapy.  multiple prospective phase i/ii trials have demonstrated that hypofractionated radiation therapy to a dose of 60 gy to 70 gy delivered over 3 to 4 weeks with 2.4 gy to 4.0 gy per day resulted in a low incidence of moderate to severe toxicity, 2-year os of 50% to 60%, and 2-year tumor local control of 80% to 90%.[31-33][level of evidence: 3iiia]stereotactic body radiation therapy (sbrt)sbrt involves the delivery of highly conformal, high-dose radiation therapy over an extremely hypofractionated course (e.g., one to five treatments) delivered over 1 to 2 weeks.  commonly used regimens include 18 gy Ã— 3, 12 gy to 12.5 gy Ã— 4, and 10 gy to 12 gy Ã— 5, and deliver a substantially higher biologically effective dose compared with historic conventional radiation therapy regimens.  multiple prospective phase i/ii trials and institutional series have demonstrated that sbrt results in a low incidence of pulmonary toxicity (<10% risk of symptomatic radiation pneumonitis), 2-year os of 50% to 60%, and 2-year tumor control of 90% to 95%.[34-40][level of evidence: 3iiia]evidence (sbrt):early phase i/ii trials from indiana university identified the maximum tolerated dose of three-fraction sbrt at 18 gy Ã— 3 for t1 tumors, and this regimen resulted in 2-year os of 55% and 2-year local tumor control of 95%.an unacceptably high incidence (8.6%) of grade 5 toxicity was observed in patients with central tumors (defined as within 2 cm of the tracheobronchial tree from the trachea to the level of the lobar bronchi).[35]a subsequent multicenter trial (rtog-0236 [nct00087438]) studied the 18 gy Ã— 3 regimen in 55 patients with peripheral t1 to t2 tumors only and demonstrated 3-year os of 56% and 3-year primary tumor control of 98%.the incidence of moderate to severe toxicity was low, with grade 3 toxicity in 24% of patients, grade 4 toxicity in 4% of patients, and no grade 5 toxicity, with a 4% incidence of grade 3 radiation pneumonitis.[39]in the largest reported series from vu university medical center amsterdam, 676 patients with t1 to t2 tumors were treated with three-, five-, and eight-fraction sbrt using a risk-adapted approach (a tailored fractionation regimen based on tumor proximity to critical organs).with a median follow-up of 32.9 months, the median os was 40.7 months, and 2-year local tumor control was 95%.[40]\\twhile central location is a contraindication to three-fraction sbrt based on data from the indiana phase ii study, a subsequent systematic review of published reports of 315 patients with 563 central tumors demonstrated a much lower incidence of severe toxicity, including a 1% to 5% risk of grade 5 events with more protracted sbrt regimens (e.g., four to ten fractions).[41]  a multicenter phase i/ii trial (rtog-0813 [nct00750269]) is ongoing to identify the maximum tolerated dose for a five-fraction sbrt regimen for central tumors. randomized trials of conventional radiation therapy versus sbrt (nct01014130), and hypofractionated radiation therapy versus sbrt (lustre [nct01968941]) are ongoing to determine the optimal radiation therapy regimen, but stereotactic body radiation therapy has been widely adopted for patients with medically inoperable stage i nsclc.']},\n",

the hazard ratio (hr) was estimated to be 0.78 (95% confidence interval [ci], 0.65â€“0.93; p = .005).[1][level of evidence: 1iia]there was a significant reduction in any cancer recurrence (local or distant) in the cmlnd group (relative risk [rr],  0.79; 95% ci, 0.66â€“0.95; p = .01) that appeared mainly as the result of a reduction in the number of distant recurrences (rr, 0.78; 95% ci, 0.61â€“1.00; p = .05).there was no difference in operative mortality.air leak lasting more than 5 days was significantly more common in patients assigned to cmlnd (rr, 2.94; 95% ci, 1.01â€“8.54; p = .05).cmlnd versus lymph node sampling  was evaluated in a large randomized phase iii trial (acosog-z0030 [nct00003831]).[2]preliminary analyses of operative morbidity and mortality showed comparable rates from the procedures.[2]there was no difference in overall survival (os), disease-free survival (dfs), local recurrence, and regional recurrence.[3][level of evidence: 1iia] current evidence suggests that lung cancer resection combined with cmlnd is not associated with improvement in survival compared with lung cancer resection combined with systematic sampling of mediastinal lymph nodes in patients with stage i, ii, or iiia nsclc.[3][level of evidence: 1iia]limitations of evidence (surgery):conclusions about the efficacy of surgery for patients with local and locoregional nsclc are limited by the small number of participants studied to date and potential methodological weaknesses of the trials.adjuvant chemotherapythe preponderance of evidence indicates that  postoperative cisplatin combination chemotherapy provides a significant survival advantage to patients with resected stage ii nsclc.  preoperative chemotherapy may also provide survival benefit. the optimal sequence of surgery and chemotherapy and the benefits and risks of  postoperative radiation therapy in patients with resectable nsclc remain to be determined. after surgery, many patients develop regional or distant\\nmetastases.[4] several randomized,  controlled trials and meta-analyses have evaluated the use of  postoperative chemotherapy in patients with stage i, ii, and iiia nsclc.[5-11]evidence (adjuvant chemotherapy):data  on individual patient outcomes were collected and pooled into a meta-analysis from the five largest trials (4,584 patients) that were conducted after 1995 of cisplatin-based chemotherapy in patients with completely resected nsclc.[7]with a median follow-up time of 5.2 years, the overall hrdeath was 0.89 (95% ci, 0.82â€“0.96; p = .005), corresponding to a 5-year absolute benefit of 5.4% from chemotherapy.the benefit varied with stage (test for trend, p = .04; hr for stage ia, 1.40; 95% ci, 0.95â€“2.06; hr for stage ib, 0.93; 95% ci, 0.78â€“1.10; hr for stage ii, 0.83; 95% ci, 0.73â€“0.95; and hr for stage iii, 0.83; 95% ci, 0.72â€“0.94).the effect of chemotherapy did not vary significantly (test for interaction, p = .11) with the associated drugs, including vinorelbine (hr, 0.80; 95% ci, 0.70â€“0.91), etoposide or vinca alkaloid (hr, 0.92; 95% ci, 0.80â€“1.07), or other drugs (hr, 0.97; 95% ci, 0.84â€“1.13). the greater effect on survival observed with the doublet of cisplatin plus vinorelbine compared with other regimens should be interpreted cautiously as the total dose of cisplatin received was significantly higher in patients treated with vinorelbine.the meta-analysis [7] and the individual studies [5,12] support the administration of  postoperative cisplatin-based chemotherapy in combination with vinorelbine.superior os for the trial population and patients with stage ii disease  was reported for the lung adjuvant cisplatin evaluation (lace) pooled analysis (pooled hr, 0.83; 95% ci, 0.73â€“0.95); the adjuvant navelbine international trialist association (anita) trial (hr, 0.71; 95% ci, 0.49â€“1.03);  and the national cancer institute of canada clinical trials group jbr.10 trial (hr, 0.59; 95% ci, 0.42â€“0.85).chemotherapy effect was higher in patients with better performance status (ps).there was no interaction between chemotherapy effect and any of the following:sex.age.histology.type of surgery.planned radiation therapy.planned total dose of cisplatin.in a retrospective analysis of a phase iii trial of  postoperative cisplatin and vinorelbine, patients older than 65 years were found to benefit from treatment.[13]chemotherapy significantly prolonged os for elderly patients (hr, 0.61; 95% ci, 0.38â€“0.98; p = .04).there were no significant differences in toxic effects, hospitalization, or treatment-related death by age group, although elderly patients received less treatment.[13]several other randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses have evaluated the use of  postoperative chemotherapy in patients with stages i, ii, and iiia nsclc.[5-11]based on these data, patients with completely resected stage ii lung cancer may benefit from  postoperative cisplatin-based chemotherapy.[13][level of evidence: 1iia]neoadjuvant chemotherapythe role of chemotherapy before surgery  was tested in clinical trials.  the proposed benefits of preoperative chemotherapy include the following:a reduction in tumor size that may facilitate surgical resection.early eradication of micrometastases.better tolerability.  preoperative chemotherapy may, however, delay potentially curative surgery.evidence (neoadjuvant chemotherapy):the cochrane collaboration reported a systematic review and meta-analysis of seven randomized controlled trials that included  988 patients and evaluated  the addition of preoperative chemotherapy to surgery versus surgery alone. these trials evaluated patients with stages i, ii, and iiia nsclc.[14]preoperative chemotherapy provided an absolute benefit in survival of 6% across all stages of disease, from 14% to 20% at 5 years (hr, 0.82; 95% ci, 0.69â€“0.97; p = .022).[14][level of evidence: 1iia]this analysis was unable to address questions such as whether particular types of patients may benefit more or less from preoperative chemotherapy.in the largest trial reported to date, 519 patients were  randomly assigned to receive either surgery alone or three cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy followed by surgery. most patients (61%) had clinical stage i disease; 31% had stage ii disease; and 7% had stage iii disease.[15]no survival advantage was seen.[15]postoperative complications were similar between groups, and no impairment of quality of life was observed.there was no evidence of a benefit in terms of os (hr, 1.02; 95% ci, 0.80â€“1.31; p = .86).updating the systematic review by addition of the present result suggests a 12% relative survival benefit with the addition of neoadjuvant (preoperative) chemotherapy (1,507 patients; hr,  0.88; 95% ci, 0.76â€“1.01; p = .07), equivalent to an absolute improvement in survival of 5% at 5 years. adjuvant radiation therapy the value of postoperative (adjuvant) radiation therapy (port) has been evaluated.[16]evidence (adjuvant radiation therapy):a meta-analysis, based on the results of ten randomized controlled trials and 2,232 individuals, reported the following:[16]an 18% relative increase in the risk of death for patients who received port compared with surgery alone (hr, 1.18; p = .002). this is equivalent to an absolute detriment of 6% at 2 years (95% ci, 2%â€“9%), reducing os from 58% to 52%. exploratory subgroup analyses suggested that this detrimental effect was most pronounced for patients with stage i/ii, n0â€“n1 disease, whereas for patients with stage iii, n2 disease there was no clear evidence of an adverse effect.results for local (hr, 1.13; p = .02), distant (hr, 1.14; p = .02), and overall (hr, 1.10; p = .06) recurrence-free survival similarly showed a detriment of port.[16][level of evidence: 1iia] further analysis is needed to determine whether these outcomes can potentially be modified with technical improvements,\\nbetter definitions of target volumes, and limitation of cardiac volume in the\\nradiation portals.',\n",

therapy\\nalone. although patients with unresectable stages iiib or iiic disease may benefit from radiation therapy, long-term outcomes have generally been poor, often the result of local and systemic relapse. the addition of sequential and concurrent chemotherapy to radiation therapy has been evaluated in prospective randomized trials.  evidence (sequential or concurrent chemotherapy and radiation therapy):a meta-analysis of patient data from 11 randomized clinical trials showed the following:[5]cisplatin-based combinations plus radiation therapy resulted in a 10% reduction in the risk of death compared with radiation therapy alone.[5][level of evidence: 1iia]a meta-analysis of 13 trials (based on 2,214 evaluable patients) showed the following:[6]the addition of concurrent chemotherapy to radical radiation therapy reduced the risk of death at 2 years (relative risk [rr], 0.93; 95% confidence interval [ci], 0.88â€“0.98; p = .01).for the 11 trials with platinum-based chemotherapy, rr was 0.93 (95% ci, 0.87â€“0.99; p = .02).[6]a meta-analysis of individual data from 1,764 patients evaluated nine trials.[7]the hazard ratio (hr)death among patients treated with radiation therapy and chemotherapy compared with radiation therapy alone was 0.89 (95% ci, 0.81â€“0.98; p = .02) corresponding to an absolute benefit of chemotherapy of 4% at 2 years.  the combination of platinum with etoposide appeared to be  more effective than platinum alone.  concomitant platinum-based chemotherapy and radiation therapy may improve survival of patients with locally advanced nsclc. however, the available data are insufficient to accurately define the size of such a potential treatment benefit and the optimal schedule of chemotherapy.[7]the results from two randomized trials (including rtog-9410 [nct01134861]) and a meta-analysis indicate that concurrent chemotherapy and radiation therapy provide greater survival benefit, albeit with more toxic effects, than sequential chemotherapy and radiation therapy.[8-10][level of evidence: 1iia]in the first trial, the combination of mitomycin c, vindesine, and cisplatin were given concurrently with split-course daily radiation therapy to 56 gy compared with chemotherapy followed by continuous daily radiation therapy to 56 gy.[8]five-year overall survival (os) favored concurrent therapy (27% vs. 9%).  myelosuppression was greater among patients in the concurrent arm, but treatment-related mortality was less than 1% in both arms.[8]in the second trial, 610 patients were randomly assigned to sequential chemotherapy with cisplatin and vinblastine followed by 63 gy of radiation therapy, concurrent chemoradiation therapy using the same regimen, or concurrent chemotherapy with cisplatin and etoposide with twice-daily radiation therapy.[9,10]median and 5-year survival were superior in the concurrent chemotherapy with daily radiation therapy arm (17 months vs. 14.6 months and 16% vs. 10% for sequential regimen [p = .046]).two smaller studies also reported os results that favored concurrent over sequential chemotherapy and radiation, although the results did not reach statistical significance.[10][level of evidence: 1iia]; [11]a meta-analysis of three trials evaluated concurrent versus sequential treatment (711 patients).[6]the analysis indicated a significant benefit of concurrent versus sequential treatment (rr,  0.86; 95% ci, 0.78â€“0.95; p = .003). all used cisplatin-based regimens and once-daily radiation therapy.[6]more deaths (3% overall) were reported in the concurrent arm, but this did not reach statistical significance (rr, 1.60; ci, 0.75â€“3.44; \\np = .2).there was more acute esophagitis (grade 3 or worse) with concurrent treatment (range, 17%â€“26%) compared with sequential treatment (range, 0%â€“4%; rr, 6.77; p = .001). overall, the incidence of neutropenia (grade 3 or worse) was similar in both arms.radiation therapy dose escalation for concurrent chemoradiationwith improvement in radiation therapyâ€“delivery technology in the 1990s, including tumor-motion management and image guidance, phase i/ii trials demonstrated the feasibility of dose-escalation radiation therapy to 74 gy with concurrent chemotherapy.[12-14]  however, a phase iii trial of a conventional dose of 60 gy versus dose escalation to 74 gy with concurrent weekly carboplatin/paclitaxel did not demonstrate improved local control or progression-free survival (pfs), and os was worse with dose escalation (hr, 1.38 [1.09â€“1.76]; p = .004). there was a nonsignificant increase in grade 5 events with dose escalation (10% vs. 2%) and higher incidence of grade 3 esophagitis (21% vs. 7%; p = .0003).[15][level of evidence: 1iia]  additional systemic therapy before or after concurrent chemotherapy and radiation therapythe addition of induction chemotherapy before concurrent chemotherapy and radiation therapy has not been shown to improve survival.[16][level of evidence: 1iia] consolidation immunotherapy durvalumabdurvalumab is a selective human igg1 monoclonal antibody that blocks programmed death ligand 1 (pd-l1) binding to programmed death 1 (pd-1) and cd80, allowing t cells to recognize and kill tumor cells.[17]evidence (durvalumab):the phase iii pacific trial (nct02125461) enrolled 713 patients with stage iii nsclc whose disease had not progressed after two or more cycles of platinum-based chemoradiation therapy. patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive durvalumab (10 mg/kg intravenously) or placebo (every 2 weeks for up to 12 months).[17] the coprimary endpoints were pfs assessed by blinded independent central review and os (unplanned for the interim analysis).\\tat the interim analysis, the coprimary endpoint of pfs was met. the median pfs was 16.8 months with durvalumab versus  5.6 months with placebo (hr, 0.52; 95% ci, 0.42â€“0.65; p < .001).[17][level of evidence:1iidiii] the 18-month pfs rate was 44.2% with durvalumab versus 27% with placebo.\\tpfs benefit was seen across all prespecified subgroups and was irrespective of pd-l1 expression before chemoradiation therapy or smoking status. epidermal growth factor receptor (egfr) mutations were observed in 6% of patients (29 treated with durvalumab vs. 14 treated with placebo). the unstratified hr for the egfr-mutated subgroup was 0.76 (95% ci, 0.35â€“1.64).\\tgrade 3 or 4 adverse events occurred in 29.9% of patients treated with durvalumab  and in 26.1% of patients treated with placebo. the most common adverse event of grade 3 or 4 was pneumonia in 4.4% of patients treated with durvalumab and in 3.8% of patients treated with placebo.\\tos was not assessed at the interim analysis.other systemic consolidation therapies    randomized trials of other consolidation systemic therapies, including docetaxel,[18] gefitinib,[19] and tecemotide (muc1 antigen-specific immunotherapy) [20] have not shown an improvement in os.[level of evidence: 1iia]the role of consolidation systemic therapy after concurrent chemotherapy and radiation therapy for unresectable nsclc remains unclear.    phase iii trials of consolidation systemic therapy including conventional chemotherapy (docetaxel),[18] tyrosine kinase inhibitors (gefitinib),[19] and immunotherapy (tecemotide: muc1 antigen-specific immunotherapy) [20] have not shown an improvement in os.[level of evidence: 1iia]radiation therapy alonefor treatment of locally advanced unresectable tumor in patients who are not candidates for chemotherapy  radiation therapy alone, administered sequentially or concurrently with chemotherapy, may provide benefit to patients with locally advanced unresectable stage iii nsclc. however, combination chemoradiation therapy delivered concurrently provides the greatest benefit in survival with an increase in toxic effects.prognosis:radiation therapy with  traditional dose and fractionation schedules (1.8â€“2.0 gy per fraction per day to 60â€“70 gy in 6â€“7

palliation and fewer re-treatments were required in previously untreated patients using ebrt alone.[24][level of evidence: 1iic]hdreb provided palliation of symptomatic patients with recurrent

or sleeve resection may be performed as appropriate. patients\\nwith impaired pulmonary function are candidates for segmental or wedge\\nresection of the primary tumor. careful preoperative assessment of the patientâ€™s overall\\nmedical condition, especially the patientâ€™s pulmonary reserve, is critical in\\nconsidering the benefits of surgery. the immediate postoperative mortality\\nrate is age related, but a 3% to 5%  mortality rate  with lobectomy can be expected.[1]evidence (surgery):the lung cancer study group conducted a\\nrandomized study (lcsg-821)  that compared lobectomy with limited resection for\\npatients with stage i lung cancer. results of the study showed the following:[2]a\\nreduction in local recurrence for patients treated with lobectomy compared with\\nthose treated with limited excision.no significant difference in overall\\nsurvival (os).similar results have been reported from a nonrandomized\\ncomparison of anatomic segmentectomy and lobectomy.[3]a survival advantage\\nwas noted with lobectomy for patients with tumors larger  than 3 cm \\nbut not for those with tumors smaller than 3 cm.the rate of\\nlocoregional recurrence was significantly less after lobectomy, regardless of\\nprimary tumor size.a study of stage i patients showed the following:[4]those treated with wedge or segmental resections had a local recurrence rate of 50% (i.e., 31 recurrences out of 62 patients) despite having undergone complete resections.[4]the cochrane collaboration reviewed 11 randomized trials with a total of 1,910 patients who underwent surgical interventions for early-stage (iâ€“iiia) lung cancer.[5] a pooled analysis of three trials reported the following:four-year survival was superior in patients with resectable stage i,  ii, or iiia nsclc who underwent resection and complete ipsilateral mediastinal lymph node dissection (cmlnd), compared with those who underwent resection and lymph node sampling; the hazard ratio (hr) was estimated to be 0.78 (95% confidence interval [ci], 0.65â€“0.93, p =  .005).[5][level of evidence: 1iia]there was a significant reduction in any cancer recurrence (local or distant) in the cmlnd group (relative risk [rr], 0.79; 95% ci, 0.66â€“0.95; p = .01) that appeared mainly because of  a reduction in the number of distant recurrences (rr,  0.78; 95% ci,  0.61â€“1.00; p = .05).there was no difference in operative mortality.air leak lasting more than 5 days was significantly more common in patients assigned to cmlnd (rr,  2.94; 95% ci,  1.01â€“8.54; p = .05). cmlnd versus lymph node   sampling  was evaluated in a large randomized phase iii trial (acosog-z0030 [nct00003831]).[6,7]preliminary analyses of operative morbidity and mortality showed comparable rates from the procedures.[6,7]there was no difference in os, disease-free survival, local recurrence, and regional recurrence.[7][level of evidence: 1iia]current evidence suggests that lung cancer resection combined with cmlnd is not associated with improvement in survival compared with lung cancer resection combined with systematic sampling of mediastinal lymph nodes in patients with stage i, ii, or iiia nsclc.[7][level of evidence: 1iia]limitations of evidence (surgery):conclusions about the efficacy of surgery for patients with local and locoregional nsclc are limited by the small number of participants studied to date and the potential methodological weaknesses of the trials.adjuvant therapymany patients treated surgically subsequently develop regional or distant\\nmetastases.[8] such patients are candidates for entry into clinical trials evaluating    postoperative treatment with chemotherapy or radiation\\ntherapy following surgery.  at present, neither chemotherapy nor radiation therapy has been found to improve the outcome of patients with stage i nsclc that has been completely resected. adjuvant radiation therapy the value of postoperative (adjuvant) radiation therapy (port) has been evaluated and has not been found to improve the outcome of patients with completely resected stage i nsclc.[9]evidence (adjuvant radiation therapy):a meta-analysis, based on the results of ten randomized controlled trials and 2,232 individuals, reported the following:[9]an 18% relative increase in the risk of death for patients who received port compared with surgery alone (hr,  1.18; p = .002). this is equivalent to an absolute detriment of 6% at 2 years (95% ci, 2â€“9), reducing os from 58% to 52%. exploratory subgroup analyses suggested that this detrimental effect was most pronounced for patients with stage i/ii, n0-n1 disease, whereas for patients with stage iii, n2 disease, there was no clear evidence of an adverse effect.results for local (hr, 1.13; p = .02), distant (hr, 1.14; p = .02), and overall (hr, 1.10; p = .06) recurrence-free survival similarly showed a detriment of port.[9][level of evidence: 1iia]further analysis is needed to determine whether these outcomes can potentially be modified with technical improvements,\\nbetter definitions of target volumes, and limitation of cardiac volume in the\\nradiation portals.    \\nadjuvant brachytherapy the value of intraoperative (adjuvant) brachytherapy applied to the suture line has been evaluated in patients undergoing sublobar resections for stage i nsclc to improve local control; it has not been found to improve outcomes. evidence (adjuvant brachytherapy):\\ta phase iii trial that randomly assigned 222 patients to undergo sublobar resection with or without suture line brachytherapy reported the following:[10]\\tno difference in the primary endpoint of local recurrence (5-year estimate, 14.0% vs. 16.7%; p = .59). \\tno difference in os (5-year estimate, 61.4% vs. 55.6%; p = .38).[10][level of evidence: 1iidiii] vs [level of evidence: 1iia]adjuvant chemotherapybased on a meta-analysis, postoperative chemotherapy is not recommended outside of a clinical trial for patients with completely resected stage i nsclc.[11,12][level of evidence: 1iia]evidence (adjuvant chemotherapy for stage i  nsclc):data on individual patient outcomes from the five largest trials (4,584 patients) that were conducted after 1995 of cisplatin-based chemotherapy in patients with completely resected nsclc were collected and pooled into a meta-analysis.[13]with a median follow-up of 5.2 years, the overall hrdeath was 0.89 (95% ci, 0.82â€“0.96; p = .005), corresponding to a 5-year absolute benefit of 5.4% from chemotherapy. the benefit \\nvaried with stage (test for trend, p = .04; hr for stage ia, 1.40; 95% ci, 0.95â€“2.06; hr for stage ib, 0.93; 95% ci, 0.78â€“1.10; hr for stage ii, 0.83; 95% ci, 0.73â€“0.95; and hr for stage iii, 0.83; 95% ci, 0.72â€“0.94).the effect of chemotherapy did not vary significantly (test for interaction, p = .11) with the associated drugs, including vinorelbine (hr, 0.80; 95% ci, 0.70â€“0.91), etoposide or vinca alkaloid (hr, 0.92; 95% ci, 0.80â€“1.07), or other drugs (hr, 0.97; 95% ci, 0.84â€“1.13).the apparent greater benefit seen with vinorelbine should be interpreted cautiously as vinorelbine and cisplatin combinations generally required that a higher dose of cisplatin be given. chemotherapy effect was higher in patients with a better performance status. there was no interaction between chemotherapy effect and any of the following:sex.age.histology.type of surgery.planned radiation therapy.planned total dose of cisplatin.several other randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses have evaluated the use of  postoperative chemotherapy in patients with stages i, ii, and iiia nsclc.[13-19]although there is sufficient evidence that postoperative chemotherapy is effective in patients with stage ii or stage iiia nsclc, its usefulness  in patients with stage ib nsclc is less clear.evidence (adjuvant chemotherapy for stage ib nsclc):the cancer and leukemia group b study (calgb-9633 [nct00002852]) addressed the results of adjuvant carboplatin and paclitaxel versus observation for  os in 344 patients with resected stage ib (i.e., pathological t2, n0) nsclc. within 4 to 8 weeks of resection, patients were randomly assigned to postoperative chemotherapy or observation.[20]survival was not significantly different (hr,  0.83; ci, 0.64â€“1.08; p = .12) at a median follow-up of 74 months.grades 3 to 4 neutropenia were the predominant toxicity; there were no treatment-related deaths.a post-hoc exploratory analysis demonstrated a significant survival difference in favor of postoperative chemotherapy for patients who had tumors 4 cm or larger in diameter (hr, 0.69; ci, 0.48â€“0.99; p = .043).  given the magnitude of observed survival differences, calgb-9633 may have been underpowered to detect small but clinically meaningful improvements in survival. in addition, the use of a carboplatin versus a cisplatin combination might have affected the results.   at present, there is no reliable evidence that postoperative chemotherapy improves survival of patients with stage ib nsclc.[20][level of evidence: 1iia]radiation therapypatients with potentially resectable tumors with medical contraindications to surgery or those with inoperable stage i disease and with sufficient pulmonary reserve\\nmay be candidates for radiation therapy with curative intent. conventional radiation therapyhistorically, conventional primary radiation therapy  consisted of approximately 60  gy to 70 gy delivered\\nwith megavoltage equipment to the midplane of the known tumor volume using\\nconventional fractionation (1.8â€“2.0 gy per day).  prognosis:in the largest retrospective conventional radiation\\ntherapy series, patients with inoperable disease treated with definitive\\nradiation therapy achieved 5-year survival rates of 10% to 30%.[21-23] several \\nseries demonstrated that patients with t1, n0 tumors had better outcomes,  and 5-year survival rates of 30% to 60% were found in this subgroup.[21,22,24] however, local-only failure occurs in as many as 50% of patients treated with conventional radiation therapy to doses in the range of 60 gy to 65 gy.[25,26] evidence (conventional radiation therapy):a single\\nreport of patients older than 70 years who had resectable lesions\\n smaller  than 4 cm but who had medically inoperable disease or who\\nrefused surgery reported the following:[24]survival at 5 years after radiation therapy with curative\\nintent was comparable with a  historical control group of patients of similar age\\nwho were resected with curative intent.a small case series using matched controls reported the following:[4]the addition of endobronchial brachytherapy improved local disease control compared with external-beam radiation therapy (ebrt).[4][level of evidence: 3iiidiii]a substantial number of patients are ineligible for standard surgical resection because of comorbid conditions that are associated with unacceptably high perioperative risk. observation and radiation therapy may be considered for these patients.[27-29] nonrandomized observational studies comparing treatment outcomes associated with resection, radiation therapy, and observation have demonstrated shorter survival times and higher mortality for patients treated with observation only.[27,30] improvements in radiation techniques include planning techniques to account for tumor motion, more conformal planning techniques (e.g., 3-d conformal radiation therapy and intensity-modulated radiation therapy), and image guidance during treatment. modern approaches to delivery of ebrt include hypofractionated radiation therapy and stereotactic body radiation therapy (sbrt).however, there are limited reliable data from comparative trials to determine which approaches yield superior outcomes.[28,29]hypofractionated radiation therapyhypofractionated radiation therapy involves the delivery of a slightly higher dose of radiation therapy per day (e.g., 2.4â€“4.0 gy) over a shorter period of time compared with conventionally fractionated radiation therapy.  multiple prospective phase i/ii trials have demonstrated that hypofractionated radiation therapy to a dose of 60 gy to 70 gy delivered over 3 to 4 weeks with 2.4 gy to 4.0 gy per day resulted in a low incidence of moderate to severe toxicity, 2-year os of 50% to 60%, and 2-year tumor local control of 80% to 90%.[31-33][level of evidence: 3iiia]stereotactic body radiation therapy (sbrt)sbrt involves the delivery of highly conformal, high-dose radiation therapy over an extremely hypofractionated course (e.g., one to five treatments) delivered over 1 to 2 weeks.  commonly used regimens include 18 gy Ã— 3, 12 gy to 12.5 gy Ã— 4, and 10 gy to 12 gy Ã— 5, and deliver a substantially higher biologically effective dose compared with historic conventional radiation therapy regimens.  multiple prospective phase i/ii trials and institutional series have demonstrated that sbrt results in a low incidence of pulmonary toxicity (<10% risk of symptomatic radiation pneumonitis), 2-year os of 50% to 60%, and 2-year tumor control of 90% to 95%.[34-40][level of evidence: 3iiia]evidence (sbrt):early phase i/ii trials from indiana university identified the maximum tolerated dose of three-fraction sbrt at 18 gy Ã— 3 for t1 tumors, and this regimen resulted in 2-year os of 55% and 2-year local tumor control of 95%.an unacceptably high incidence (8.6%) of grade 5 toxicity was observed in patients with central tumors (defined as within 2 cm of the tracheobronchial tree from the trachea to the level of the lobar bronchi).[35]a subsequent multicenter trial (rtog-0236 [nct00087438]) studied the 18 gy Ã— 3 regimen in 55 patients with peripheral t1 to t2 tumors only and demonstrated 3-year os of 56% and 3-year primary tumor control of 98%.the incidence of moderate to severe toxicity was low, with grade 3 toxicity in 24% of patients, grade 4 toxicity in 4% of patients, and no grade 5 toxicity, with a 4% incidence of grade 3 radiation pneumonitis.[39]in the largest reported series from vu university medical center amsterdam, 676 patients with t1 to t2 tumors were treated with three-, five-, and eight-fraction sbrt using a risk-adapted approach (a tailored fractionation regimen based on tumor proximity to critical organs).with a median follow-up of 32.9 months, the median os was 40.7 months, and 2-year local tumor control was 95%.[40]\\twhile central location is a contraindication to three-fraction sbrt based on data from the indiana phase ii study, a subsequent systematic review of published reports of 315 patients with 563 central tumors demonstrated a much lower incidence of severe toxicity, including a 1% to 5% risk of grade 5 events with more protracted sbrt regimens (e.g., four to ten fractions).[41]  a multicenter phase i/ii trial (rtog-0813 [nct00750269]) is ongoing to identify the maximum tolerated dose for a five-fraction sbrt regimen for central tumors. randomized trials of conventional radiation therapy versus sbrt (nct01014130), and hypofractionated radiation therapy versus sbrt (lustre [nct01968941]) are ongoing to determine the optimal radiation therapy regimen, but stereotactic body radiation therapy has been widely adopted for patients with medically inoperable stage i nsclc.treatment options under clinical evaluationtreatment options under clinical evaluation include the following:clinical trials of  postoperative chemoprevention (as evidenced in the eastern  cooperative oncology group (ecog) (ecog-5597 [nct00008385] trial, for example).endobronchial therapies, including photodynamic therapy, for highly selected patients with t1, n0, m0 tumors.current clinical trialsuse our advanced

have stage i nsclc, surgery may be the only treatment you need. this may be done either by taking out the lobe of the lung that has the tumor (lobectomy) or by taking out a smaller piece of the lung (sleeve resection, segmentectomy, or wedge resection). at least some lymph nodes in the lung and in the space between the lungs will also be removed and checked for cancer.  segmentectomy or wedge resection is generally an option only for very small stage i cancers and for patients with other health problems that make removing the entire lobe dangerous. still, most surgeons believe it is better to do a lobectomy if the patient can tolerate it, as it offers the best chance for cure.  for people with stage i nsclc that has a higher risk of coming back (based on size, location, or other factors), adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery may lower the risk that cancer will return. but doctors arenâ€™t always sure how to determine which people are likely to be helped by chemo. new lab tests that look at the patterns of certain genes in the cancer cells may help with this. studies are now being done to see if these tests are accurate.  after surgery, the removed tissue is checked to see if there are cancer cells at the edges of the surgery specimen (called positive margins). this could mean that some cancer has been left behind, so a second surgery might be done to try to ensure that all the cancer has been removed. (this might be followed by chemotherapy as well.) another option might be to use radiation therapy after surgery.  if you have serious health problems that prevent you from having surgery, you may get stereotactic body radiation therapy (sbrt) or another type of radiation therapy as your main treatment. radiofrequency ablation (rfa) may be another option if the tumor is small and in the outer part of the lung.
